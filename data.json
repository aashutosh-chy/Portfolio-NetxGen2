      "description": "The measurement of instantaneous torque in terms of voltage displaying rotating speed in revolution per minute (RPM) of a rotating shaft is known as a digital tachometer. An infrared module is used as the input that senses the interruption in terms of beam of rays caused by rotating shaft, generating a pulse. The usual method of counting pulse coming from the encoder in a fixed period of time produces a high precision velocity estimate in the high-speed range. The encoded signal is latched and further sent to decoder that decodes the latched pulse i.e. speed displayed in 7 segment display. This paper mainly focuses on developing a contact-less digital tachometer of maximum 3digit with the help of integrated circuits (ICs).",
